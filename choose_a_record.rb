## `choose_a_record` (also LeanData)

# Write a method that takes a hash of symbol keys, for which the values are
# integers representing each key's weight. The method returns a key such that the
# chances of selecting a particular key are weighted by that key's value.

# For the hash {:a => 1, :b => 2, :c => 3}, the chance of returning :c is 1/2, :b is 1/3, and :a is 1/6.
