You have two sticks and a matchbox. Each stick takes exactly an hour
to burn from one end to the other.

The sticks are weird, in that they do not burn at a steady. If you
break a stick in half, it is not guaranteed that each half will take
30min to burn.

How would you measure exactly 45 minutes by burning these sticks?

1 hour = 60 minutes

45 minutes = 0.75 hours

2 matches burn for 120 minutes.

If it were a steady rate
I would fold one of the matches in half, then another half to make forths,
then break off the last fourth

Since it's not steady, I can't rely on fractions for this

They gave me a matchbox; that seems weird, so it must be part of the solution.
Maybe I could burn the matchbox and take fractions of that? But it might take
shorter than an hour to burn the entire matchbox.
Maybe I could use folding the matchbox or ripping it up?

I could light up both ends of the matches, and when they meet, that
would be 30 minutes.
I can't assume that the other match will have the same "middle"

Note: I couldn't figure it out from here; I was obsessed with using the box.
It turns out it was excess information :( I should have figured. Anyways,
I had figured out the gist of it. It sucks that I couldn't figure out the
last part.
